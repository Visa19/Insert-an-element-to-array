In this Java program, users have the flexibility to define the length of an array based on their requirements. After initializing the array, the program allows users to dynamically insert an element at a specified position within the array. This interactive feature enhances the program's user-friendliness, enabling individuals to not only create arrays of varying lengths but also to efficiently customize their content. By incorporating dynamic array creation and element insertion, this program provides a practical illustration of Java's array manipulation capabilities, offering users an intuitive experience in managing and manipulating array data.
